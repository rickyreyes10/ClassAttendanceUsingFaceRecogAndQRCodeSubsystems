            Recording your attendance is straightforward and secure with my 'Student' portal. Begin by clicking on the 'Student' button from the homepage. You will be prompted to enter the Course Reference Number (CRN) assigned to your class. Once entered, you will be directed to choose between two state-of-the-art attendance verification systems - Facial Recognition or QR Code scanning.

            For the Facial Recognition option, ensure your device's camera is enabled. Position yourself in clear view of the camera and follow the on-screen instructions to capture your attendance. The system will compare your image against the class database in real-time, providing a quick and seamless verification process.

            If you opt for the QR Code system, use your device's camera to scan the unique QR code provided by your instructor at the start of the class. The code will be scanned, and your attendance will be logged instantly. This method is especially useful if you're attending the class remotely or prefer a contactless check-in process.

            Whichever system you choose, my platform guarantees a user-friendly experience. Should you encounter any difficulties, such as lighting issues for facial recognition or scanning errors with the QR code, simple troubleshooting steps are available within the platform. My support team is also on hand to provide assistance, ensuring your attendance is recorded promptly and accurately, every time.
